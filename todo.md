Todo Items:
Add Validation for role selected
Add clock to home page
Disable clock in button
Error message sucks for invalid pin
default cash entered to 0
Add a welcome message that disappears after a few seconds.
Clean up debug stuff
Better errors overall
clean up ClockedIn error handling

Low Priority:
install elmjutsu
the message "You've Clocked In successfully!" is super annoying... why does it have to be a popup? Can't it just dissapear after a bit?

Separate app for managing admin stuff, like employee data, roles, that kinda thing
